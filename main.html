        <h2>What I Admire</h2>
        <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as the Father of the Nation, was a remarkable freedom fighter of India. His philosophy of non-violence and his leadership in the Indian independence movement have left an indelible mark on history. Gandhi's unwavering commitment to justice, peace, and equality inspires me. His ability to mobilize and unite people towards a common cause, his selflessness, and his unwavering dedication to the principles of truth and non-violence are qualities I deeply admire.</p>
